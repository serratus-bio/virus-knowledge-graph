I pooled in the STAT host associations from all SRA runs associated to all palmprints associated to SOTUs in the dataset. The overlap between these SOTUs with STAT associations to primates (order-level homo sapiens) that also have a true IsZoonotic label using the zoonotic dataset has ~0.35 Jaccard similarity. \n",

Instead of genes, the host classes will be considered as classes in a functional class scoring (FCS) significance test. First I'll need to find the log2 fold changes between positive and negative groups, then I'll need to compute the enrichment score with significance values. It's not clear how well this will work for small sets, i'm also not sure if I can use existing GSEA libraries directly (DESeq2).\n",

The graph of a given SOTU would include: the SOTU, highly similar other SOTUs, the full taxonomy heirachy (?), relationships between the SOTU and the taxonomy heirarchy (STAT, virus tax id). We should be able to measure significance between the positive and negative groups using Fisher's test on these metrics."
